Blog-F16-Text Encoding Initiative

Smooth sailing to start off. [Recovered Histories](http://www.recoveredhistories.org/) seems fairly trustworthy. There are many citations made and the 'about' page is complete. An early flag is raised by the site seeming to deal only with writings of British and American abolitionists - therefore skewing any claim of representing a representative sample of the population. Further, the 'themed naratives' give the impression that these pages have already been analyzed and are being presented in a specific framework. This is not to cast issues on said framework, but rather acknowledge that this is not raw data in the strict sense. As a whole, however, this site seems fairly trustworthy. I have located the pamplet 8Negro Slavery8 by Zachary Macaulay and am ready to begin.

I chose to examine page 72 (Image page 38): Evidence of John Williamson, M.D.  After painstaking typing and even more fussy encoding (including multiple errors I had to solve), I successfully completed the exercise. Everything worked well except the 'individual' tagging as no web biography or reference existed other than the one book. This is not an exercise that could be easily repeated and I question its effectiveness. This is good to know - and from the conversion to csv I can see the value to having large quantities of xml markup, but I can't help but wonder if there are more efficient methods of accomplishing the same results. Clearly, there is a great amount of data that can be extracted from this sort of coding (and the csv conversions are fascinating and hold great potential). All that being said, despite the success, this exercise was very frustrating!

I took a look at the SG_transformer and understand the value it has after finishing transcriptions and tagging. Perhaps if something like OxygenXML editor had a VERY easy to use tagging function, I could see myself using this. However, I hope future exercises will help with efficiency of time usage.
