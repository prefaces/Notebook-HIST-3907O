M1E3 Hitchcock Keynote 5

The shear depth of the study shown of Sarah Durrant is impressive. This case study shows the vast potential for digital history when applied. When using these techniques, I believe a far greater picture of Durrant's life can be reconstructed and visibly presented. The only caution I would offer would be giving this sort of microhistory too much significance. While I acknowledge a great deal of information can be obtained using these methods about the lives of ordinary people during the time period in question, what can be gathered from someone's life is not always a fair representation of that person or the people around them. Here my bias as a student well versed in the canon of 'old dead white men' may emerge but I believe that it is through the voices of the prominent, the popular, the thoughtful, and those who have been deemed worthy of being passed on that one can learn the most about a certain time period. That is certainly not to say that this sort of historical study is invalid or superfluous, but it is only to argue that there are some limits we should acknowledge before greater claims are made than can be substantiated.
