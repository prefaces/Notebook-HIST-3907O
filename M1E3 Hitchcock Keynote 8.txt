M1E3 Hitchcock Keynote 8

Expanding on the section describing the projects like the Virtual St Paul's Cross, I am struck by the vast performative potential held by digital history. I understand that history graduate studies at Carleton are particularly interested in this notion of performativity. Bridging the space between text and the material world seems to offer untold potential for the study of history. I am confident that historical studies will continue to include greater incorporation of these techniques and that digital humanities will continue to expand its influence.

Again on a side note, I have been thinking about the notion of performativity lately. Again using a recent example from Humanities 4000's study of Hannah Arendt, we were considering the notion of human action. For Arendt, action fascilitates the possibility for immortality through speech and action. While I won't go into why this is so or its many conclusions, I will say that the notion of performativity is something that makes us distinctly human. By offering the potential to go beyond the merely textual when presenting history, digital humanities gives us the ability to more accurately and effectivly represent our historical subjects. Definitely something to continue to consider!
