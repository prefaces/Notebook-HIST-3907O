Blog-J16-January

This has been a frustrating month for me in terms of accomplishing a great deal of digital history work. I have found myself to be extremely busy with my responsibilities that have seen me run an academic conference, coordinate the publication of an undergrad student journal on international affairs, apply for Masters programs, and keep up with my other school work. Unfortunately, this class was frequently the casualty when I had to triage my responsibilities. Additionally, after the frustration of setting up my Git-Hub account, I needed a break from this work.

Despite these struggles, I am optimistic for continuing this course. I am concluding the first module a week and bit late but I am confident that I will be caught up within the next week or two. While online classes are nice insofar as you can set your own working timeline, they require individual discipline. I am happy to learn that while not stringent, I do possess sufficient discipline to self-propel myself through the course.

With my busy January behind me, I look forward to spending more time learning and practicing digital history. Can't wait for what's next!
