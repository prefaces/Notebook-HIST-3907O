Hitchcock Keynote Note 2 (worth reading)

The Mumford quote he uses is fantastic! We were recently discussing a very similar concept in my Humanities 4000 class (though admitedly not in reference to technology). I know this is only tangentally connected to this reading but bare with me as I work this out (and I suspect this may happen frequently). The basic premise of our discussion came from the Hiedeggerian terminology of 'enframing' that was employed throughout our study of Hannah Arendt. There are limits to human knowledge and the creation of knowledge frameworks. For example, when we pose a scientific question asking the world or the universe to report back based on our understanding of it, we are frequently greeted with an affirmative answer. A good example of this would be the Big Bang theory. It is remarkable that the scientific theory postulated so closely resembles the unconscious human tendency to systematize and philosophize about the metaphysical origins of the universe - namely regarding oneness and a single moment of creation. While this very well be an accurate theory reflecting a fundamental universal truth, the point is that we ask these questions within a certain frame of reference. When I consider this quote from Mumford, I am struck by the similarities. While computers and digital technologies can offer a phenomenal range of possibilities for the creation and supplementation of knowledge, inherent limits should be acknowledged. An acknowledgment of these limites limits accompanied by a desire to push beyond these limits should be a trait of all digital historians.
