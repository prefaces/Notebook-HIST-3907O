Hitchcock Keynote Note 10

Perfectly following Hitchcock, I wrap up this series of notes by looking at his final paragraph: "I refuse to forget that my object of study, my objective, is an emotional, imaginative and empathetic engagement with Sarah Durrant, and all the people like her." This is a great way to cap off an intriguing article. In many ways I am also just summarizing things I have stated previously. Hitchcock's acknowledgement of the limits and dangers of a blind pursuit of the tools of digital history are excellent. In many ways, we live in a very mechanistic, technology-driven world. Remembering to frequently take a step back and consider what we are doing and why we are doing it is an incredibly enviable skill to have. Whether or not it is to my benefit, I will continue to state my Humanities background and critical thinking skills on the cover letters I send out when seeking summer employment. When we live in a world that values the ability to function within a certain technological environment, the ability to consider this environment and how it is shaping our operations and the questions we are asking is critical. This is also true of the study of digital history. I hope to continue to bring this critical engagement to history's study, even when I am immersed in the exciting potential of the new technologies I am learning!
