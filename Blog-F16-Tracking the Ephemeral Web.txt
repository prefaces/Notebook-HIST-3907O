Blog-F16-Tracking the Ephemeral Web

This post is in reference to the excellent [article](http://www.anonymousswisscollector.com/2015/10/saving-info-and-your-skin-on-the-ephemeral-internet-a-how-to-for-researchers.html) by Donna Yates on the importance of saving a record of any information you use from the internet. I have experiemented with Zotero in this course but am just being introduced to the extensive use of online sources in this course. I have yet to determine a specific methodology for how I deal with online sources. One source of success for this course already is alerting me to these methodological issues and prompting me to give them some thought.

I have yet to choose a final project topic for this class but have started to give it more thought. A part of me is still waiting to learn more about the technology used in this course so I have a better sense of what is possible. As my final planning is still in its infancy, I have yet to determine how I will be handling my sources and data. I was already familiar with the Wayback Machine but was alarmed to learn of the ability for websites to take down information from the Wayback Machine if they desired. The Harvard database [Perma.cc](https://perma.cc/) looks particularly promising and I will be looking into that further. Finally, I will be trying to do a more thorough organizational job with [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and will download [Bibdesk](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/) presently.

Online archiving is particularly appealing for me. I like to have the ability to return to things weeks/months/years later. Like any researcher on the internet, I have certainly run into instances of broken links (particularly with news sites). I hope to incorporate some of Yates' suggestions as I continue to develop my online presence. For the time being, my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/prefaces/) and its desktop clone is a sufficient catalogue for my course work (though I may address these in the future).
