Blog-F16-The Dream Case

I searched the [Epigraphic Database Heidelberg](http://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/inschrift/suche?hd_nr=&land=&fo_antik=&fo_modern=&literatur=&dat_jahr_a=&dat_jahr_e=&atext1=doctrina&bool=AND&atext2=&sort=hd_nr&anzahl=20) for the term 'doctrina' (meaning learning). This search was done after brainstorming several searches turning up either no results or a lot of results. I chose to use this term because I was looking for potentially educated individuals with the potential to follow up my inquiry with a search for literature. My later analysis will determine if this hope can be realized. For the time being, this file is saved in my Git Hub 'Data' Repository under the name "Database Search Doctrina".

I also searched the [Commonwealth War Graves Commission](http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead.aspx?cpage=1) for the surname: Swinden. This is my mother's last name as yields more managable results than my last name Doyle. For the time being, this file is saved in my Git Hub 'Data' Repository' under the name "Database Search Swinden".

Just as a closing note, I hope I have the opportunity to return to the data I collected and do some analysis with it. I am assuming that this will be covered in a later exercise, but for the time being, I suppose I am left with unanalyzed datasets. A little frustrating but I am trying to remain positive and assume that we will learn more soon that we will be able to apply to this data.
