M1E3 Hitchcock Keynote 7

I think the analysis Hitchcock conducts after finishing his case study is excellent. I just wanted to touch on his closing point before continuing to follow his argument: "when everything is digital, everything can be read in a new way." Here is where I think the digital humanities have the most potential. They can be useful to providing tools to separate disciplines but boast the greatest potential when combining many disciplines. These 'new forms of reading' are fascinating. While there is and will continue to be a great deal of value and significance placed on text (and should be due to the significance it has for humans more generally), the opportunity to challenge the limits of what can and cannot be studied is incredible. I hope this course will provide the opportunity to glimpse some of these new forms of reading as they offer a great deal of excitement at this present time!
