M1E3 Hitchcock Keynote 4

This question of combining close and distant reading into a single intellectual practise is of great personal interest. I have always been skeptical at claims for the ability of technology to replace close reading of a text, while I have also seen the benefits distant reading can do. I hope that this course can help me develop some of the tools to supplement my work in other fields. I have always understood digital history to be of a supplemental rather than primary mode of analysis. I wonder if this course will adjust my views.
