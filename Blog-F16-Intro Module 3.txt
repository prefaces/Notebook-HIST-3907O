Blog-F16-Intro Module 3

Having emerged victorious from the second module of this course, I thought it would be helpful for me to create a short post about where I am in the course right now. There has been a very steep technological learning curve so far. That being said, I am starting to get the hang of some of these programs and am getting excited by the many possibilities they offer! Moving into the next exercises on wrangling data, I am optimistic that I will start flying through course material!

As a side note before I look at some of the articles given to set the groundwork before the exercises, I just want to comment about an encounter I had recently. I was talking about this course with a friend who does lots of computer programming and design work. Having obtained some of the technical vocabulary through this course, I was able to (somewhat) understand many of the things he was doing! It really is amazing what a bit of familiarity can do to accelerate your learning! We started chatting about regular expressions and some of the usages he had for them. I opened the third module of the workbook and - wouldn't you know - we will be learning about regular expressions! This brief encounter was rewarding as it allowed me to see that I have already come a long way from where I started! [Here he is on Github](https://github.com/cpmsmith).

Turning back to the intro to Module 3, the importance of understanding how [OCR](http://www.utpjournals.press/doi/abs/10.3138/chr.694) works quickly grabbed my attention. I, like many of my generation, have grown up with internet and database search engines. I for one have given little thought to how these are created or constructed. While I do not have anywhere near the technical expertise required to understand fully, the consciousness of the methodological shortcomings is an important first step.

I have not previously thought about the use of crowdsourcing to transcribe/translate. The [two](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000125/000125.html) [articles](http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/2/119.abstract) about the [Transcribe Bentham Project](http://www.transcribe-bentham.da.ulcc.ac.uk/td/Transcribe_Bentham) pointed to some fascinating new applications for historical research using digital technology and crowdsourcing. Greater partnerships between projects such as these and academic university classes (ie assignments for marks) could greatly help this growing movement. I much prefer this version of crowdsourcing to the kind that seeks to raise money! I continued reading and found Electric Archaeology's [article](http://electricarchaeology.ca/2012/05/18/how-i-lost-the-crowd-a-tale-of-sorrow-and-hope/) on the loss of his crowdsourced project. I think this just hammers home the message for all of us that a careful examination of research methodology, project design, and back-ups is critical for any large digital project. This certainly sounded heartbreaking but the publication of issues encountered is critical to build knowledge and make sure others do not make the same mistakes.

Almost every writer of digital history projects talks about a regret for not having a more comprehensive methodology and rigid project design. This is something **I need** to keep in mind when I design my final project for this class. Beals' [article](http://mhbeals.com/xmling-my-way-to-data-management-or-what-should-i-do-with-all-my-old-notes/) on XML data management hits this message home:
> "Had I been starting a wholly new project, with new data and new objectives, creating a detailed data management plan using XML would have be a relative simple and obvious step in my research work-flow. I could have created a schema to ensure consistency alongside a detailed dictionary of the keywords and entities for encoding the text."[1]

The notion of having a project be entirely machine readable (especially when we are talking about large projects) is very appealing. The message shines through: **data management is essential at the start of a project**. I may choose to follow up and learn more about XML (and wouldn't you know it - a convenient link to [Oxygen](http://www.oxygenxml.com/) was given (although reading further, I learn that my already-downloaded Notepad++ will be sufficient for the time being).

I truly am struck by how fascinating these discussion are! Thiese sorts of data manipulation and project management design are the most interesting concepts I have encountered in this course. I look forward to exploring them in great detail! Note to self: I will return to the [article](http://dh.obdurodon.org/what-is-xml.xhtml) on XML as it looks excellent. For the time being, I no longer have the concentration to read another article of this sort and further feel that I do not yet have the technical vocabulary to understand it without greater effort. I will revisit this later this week (I'll even have Slackbot give me a reminder!).

That's all for now, time for the exercises!
