Hitchcock Keynote Note 9

Hitchcock brings the article back to one of his opening premises with an interesting discussion of positivism and shaping the questions we ask based on the available tools and data. The dangers of being driven by technology are a concern that should be taken seriously. For anyone who doubts this notion, take a walk through any university campus and observe the number of people glued to their cell phones. These questions (surprise surprise) have been debated in our Humanities 4000 and some of our supplemental classes this year. Writers like Martin Heidegger and George Grant provide a bridge to the academic sphere of debate. While the questions they pose deserve careful consideration, the most important thing for digital historians to remember is that these are tools and not substitutes for an honest intellectual study of various disciplines within the humanities.
