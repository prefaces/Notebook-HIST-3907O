Hitchcock Keynote Note 6

Upon reading further through the case study, I am impressed with the way the author is using these techniques as tools and complementing them with thoughtful analysis. I must say that this study is very well done. I like how the author extended his study of the individual to greater trends that can be seen.

Another feature that comes to mind when considering these trial analyses is the seemingly time intensive process whereby these records can be systemetized. Despite the many potential uses for digital history to aid analysis of projects within fields related to the humanities, it becomes clear that they are not a shortcut to better work.
