M1E3 Hitchcock Keynote 1

Hitchcock is posing a question I would frequently associate with digital humanities - does this exercise collapse boundaries. I think it starts to erase some of the distinctions but not necessarily collapse the boundaries. In many ways, I find academic disciplines to be too stringent in their respective foci and lines of demarcation. Perhaps digital humanities is an excellent tool to start to ease these hard boundaries?
